                                    Ever since leaving India, cooking is how I stay connected to my roots. Shef has given me a sense of purpose and pride. Now I get to cook for my community and make a substantial income that I can rely on.

                                    I learned to cook from my mother in our village in Southern China. When we immigrated to the US, we brought along the flavors of our hometown. With Shef, I can now share those flavors with my entire community.

                                    I was born and raised in Tehran, Iran, where I began learning traditional recipes from my grandmother. I'm honored to share our family recipes at your kitchen table, and I hope they'll fill you with a feeling of home.
